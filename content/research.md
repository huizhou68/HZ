My research interests are twofold. First, I am interested in social policy from a comparative perspective. I pay particular attention to how governments devise social policies to improve the wellbeing of their people in the context of changing global dynamics. In this regard, I have coauthored a book chapter on China's social policy development in the areas of healthcare, education, and social welfare through the lens of social equity. Besides, I am working on a project that looks at the pension policy in major OECD countries. It shows that advanced welfare states may have to balance between inclusiveness and generosity due to income inequality and partisan politics.

Second, I pay much attention to Chinese politics. Broadly speaking, I am concerned about whether/how the state, which is essentially authoritarian, can be checked and constrained by formal institutions and/or mass attitudes. My recent publication on China's administrative litigations shows that, in spite of an attempt to increase the autonomy of judiciary at the subnational level, citizens and social organizations are at a disadvantage relative to the core state agents. My dissertation takes a different approach to the accountability issue. I look at how the state holds its agents accountable for a variety of technological disasters such as explosions, gas leaks and transportation accidents. 

Below is my published research, as well as some projects in progress.
