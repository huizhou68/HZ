In collaboration with Professor Ling Zhu, I have completed a book chapter on China's social policy. Edited by Professor Morgen Johansen, the book is titled _Social Equity in the Asian-Pacific Region: Conceptualizations and Realities_ and it was published in May, 2019. This book chapter offers a detailed overview of the evolvement of social equity across three major policy areas, including healthcare, education, and social welfare.

I have a forthcoming article at _Social Science and Medicine_. This study examines the relationship between hospital violence and protest outcome in China. It demonstrates that there is a rational motivation behind the widespread hospital violence in China. A higher level of violence, characterized by a larger number of protest participants and a longer protest, can make compensation more likely and once compensated, the amount of the compensation is higher. The link between violence and outcome has to do with the Chinese government, which tends to intervene in medical disputes when substantial violence is present, pressing hospitals to pacify protesters by making compensation.

I am working on other projects as well. My qualifying paper is focused on the determinants of pension policy design in advanced democracies, with a particular focus on the configuration of program coverage and welfare generosity. My study reveals that the trade-off between generosity and inclusiveness is influenced by income inequality and partisan politics. Income inequality is associated with a higher replacement rate, especially when the left party is in power. Multinomial regressions show that income inequality and legislative fractionalization result in welfare expansion separately, but they collectively make welfare expansion less likely and welfare retrenchment more likely. This paper is currently under review.

In addition, I am collaborating with Professor Ling Zhu to investigate how policy stance affects political behaviors among ethnic minorities in the United States. I am also engaged in a comparative study of social policy change across OECD countries (with Professors Scott Hofer and Ling Zhu).
