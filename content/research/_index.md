In collaboration with Professor Ling Zhu, I have completed a book chapter on China's social policy. Edited by Professor Morgen Johansen, the book is titled _"Social Equity in the Asian-Pacific Region: Conceptualizations and Realities"_ and it was published in May, 2019. This book chapter offers a detailed overview of the evolvement of social equity across three major policy areas, including healthcare, education, and social welfare.

I am working on other projects as well, including a working paper on ethnic minorities' political participation and policy stance (with Professor Ling Zhu) and a comparative study of social policy change across OECD countries (with Scott Hofer and Professor Ling Zhu). My qualifying paper aims to probe the determinants of social policy design in advanced industrialized countries, with a particular focus on the configuration of program coverage and welfare generosity.
