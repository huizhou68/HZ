On this page, I would like to share some resources that might be helpful for research or teaching.

* **_scrapol_**: This is an R package developed for automatic data collection with the help of Hadley Wickham's `rvest` package. It was written specifically for collecting information about city councilmembers' Party ID and district or ward given a councilmember's Ballotpedia URL alone. This package has not been submitted to CRAN yet, but it it is available on Github. If interested, please click [here](https://github.com/huizhou68/scrapol) to check it out.
* **_pqview_**: This is a simple Web App developed in Shiny to facilitate my teaching. When I taught statistics and research design, a critical topic is critical values (quantiles), probabilities and p values  (significance level) in a continuous distribution such as a normal distribution or a Student's t distribution. The traditional way of covering this topic is to resort to some Z tables or T tables, but students usually get very frustrated with dense decimals in a table. In consequence, I created this Web App to visualize the relationship between quantiles and probabilities in a standard normal distribution. It permits both one-tailed and two-tailed scenarios. It is available below.
