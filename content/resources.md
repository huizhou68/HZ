title: Academic Resources
---

I am passionate about programming and automation in my daily work. Here are some academic resources that I would like to share. I created these tools to facilitate my research and teaching. I will be very happy if these tools could help others.

* **_scrapol_**: This is an R package developed for automatic data collection with the help of Hadley Wickham's `rvest` package. It was written specifically for collecting information about city councilmembers' Party ID and district given their URLs on Ballotpedia. This package makes automatic data collection possible with a URL alone, and users don't need to have any knowledge about web scraping. It has not been submitted to CRAN yet, but it is available on my Github page. If interested, please click [**here**](https://github.com/huizhou68/scrapol) to check it out.
* **_pqview_**: This is a simple web app or dashboard developed with Shiny to facilitate teaching. When I taught statistics, a critical topic was probabilities and quantiles in a continuous distribution. The traditional way of covering this topic is to resort to some Z tables or T tables, but students usually get very frustrated with dense decimals in a table. Besides, 'static' tables cannot display all possible degrees of freedom, quantiles, and significance levels. For these reasons, I created this dashboard to visualize the relationship between quantiles and probabilities in four widely used continuous distributions: standard normal distribution, Student's t-distribution, F distribution, and $\chi^2$ distribution. This dashboard permits both one-tailed and two-tailed scenarios. It is available below, but users may access it on an independent page via this [**link**](https://huizhou68.shinyapps.io/pqview/).
