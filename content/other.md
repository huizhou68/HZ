Hello, I'm Hugo Grotius and this is my personal page. I'm a Dutch lawyer and
diplomat with experience from academia and government, having published a large
number of books on international law, sometimes even being called the "father"
of this field of study. .

After having been wrongfully convicted of treason in the Netherlands and
being handed a life sentence, I managed to escape with the help of my dear
wife Maria. She brought a chest of books to the prison where I was incarcerated
(nothing out of the ordinary since I am an avid reader) which was then
transported back out of the prison, with the the books replaced by yours truly!
