title: About Me
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Houston. Before attending graduate school, I earned a B.A. in Economics (2014) and an M.A. in Management (2016) in China. I major in public policy and my minor is comparative politics. I am particularly interested in social policy and Chinese politics. My dissertation focuses on how authoritarian states like China deals with accountability in the absence of competitive elections and other democratic means.
