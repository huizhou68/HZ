---

My name is Hui Zhou. As of May 2019, I am entering my third year as a Ph.D student of Political Science at the University of Houston. Prior to coming to UH, I earned my bachelor's degree in International Economy and Trade in 2014 and the master's degree in Public Administration in 2016 in China. Being a policy major and comparative minor, I am interested in the comparative studies of social policy and political causes and consequences of economic inequality in the U.S. context.
