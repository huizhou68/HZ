---

My name is Hui Zhou, a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Houston. Prior to coming to UH, I earned a B.A. in International Economy and Trade in 2014 and a M.A. in Public Administration in 2016 in China. Being a policy major and comparative minor, I am interested in Chinese politics and social policy. My dissertation focuses on the causes and consequences of accountability in China. I have published three peer-reviewed articles at Social Science & Medicine, Journal of Contemporary China, and International Journal of Legal Medicine.

My CV is available [**here**](/HZ_CV2020.pdf).
