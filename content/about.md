title: About Me
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Houston. Prior to coming to UH, I earned a B.A. in International Economy and Trade in 2014 and an M.A. in Public Administration in 2016 in China. As a policy major and comparative minor, I am interested in social policy and Chinese politics. My dissertation focuses on how authoritarian states like China deals with accountability in the absence of competitive elections and other democratic means. To this end, I have constructed a dataset of nearly 2,500 technological disasters taking place in the last two decades in China.
