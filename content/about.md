I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Houston. Prior to coming to UH, I earned a B.A. in International Economy and Trade in 2014 and an M.A. in Public Administration in 2016 in China. As a policy major and comparative minor, I am interested in social policy and Chinese politics. My dissertation focuses on the causes and consequences of accountability in China. I have published one book chapter and three peer-reviewed journal articles at _Social Science & Medicine_, _Journal of Contemporary China_ and _International Journal of Legal Medicine_.
