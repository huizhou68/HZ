In Spring 2024, I taught three courses at Saint Louis University: (1) POLS 1100 Introduction to American Government; (2) POLS 2000 Methods in Political Science; (3) POLS 3930 Introduction to Chinese Politics.

* _POLS 1100 Introduction to American Government_ is designed to familiarize undergraduates with core political institutions and policy issues in the United States. Particular attention was paid to the legislative process via a Legislative Simulation project, in which students were randomly assigned to play different roles in a simulated Congress. The goal of this class is to increase students' political knowledge and to help students understand how politics works in the United States.

* _POLS 2000 Methods in Political Science_ is a quantitative methods class aimed to help students pick up necessary skills to understand social science research and to pursue scientific examination of socioeconomic and political issues. This course covered a broad range of skills ranging from descriptive statistics to hypothesis testing, regression analysis and experimental research. The R-based lab session made sure that students could apply scientific methodology with the help of mainstream statistical software.

* _POLS 3930 Introduction to Chinese Politics_ is a new course I developed at Saint Louis University. This course not only reviewed China's political development and economic reform but also discussed a broad range of policy issues, such as environmental pollution, information control and population crises. This course aims to enable students to acquire substantive knowledge and analytical skills so that they can make sense of China's political, economic and social phenomena against the backdrop of its growing influence around the globe.

In Fall 2023, I taught _POLS 1510 Politics of the Developing World_, an intro-level comparative politics course. It introduces students to a wide array of topics pertaining to developing countries with the aim of discovering political institutions and public policies that make a country a good society. [[Syllabus](/POLS1510Syllabus.pdf) | [Teaching Evaluation](/POLS1510Evaluation.pdf)]

In Summer 2023, I taught _DACSS 601 Data Science Fundamentals_ for the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This is an entry-level data science course aimed at helping students get prepared for more advanced learning topics. In this course, I covered base R, Tidyverse, data visualization, Python basics, as well as R programming skills including functions, conditions and loops. Additionally, this course devoted several sections to the application of R programming in various contexts such as Shiny dashboard development and web scraping with rvest.

In Spring 2023, I taught _GOVT 2035 U.S. Government: Congress, President and Courts_ at the University of Houston. This course discusses fundamental political institutions in the United States, such as Congress, presidency, courts and bureaucracy. Additionally, it also covers some important policy topics, including criminal justice, economic policy and immigration. [[Syllabus](/GOVT2305Syllabus.pdf) | [Teaching Evaluation](/Spring2023GOVT2305Evaluation.pdf)]

In Fall 2022, I taught *POLS 3312 Arguments, Data and Politics* at the University of Houston. This course is aimed at helping students understand social science research and if possible, conduct their own research. It covers topics ranging from theory building to measurement, experimental research, and observational studies. [[Syllabus](/POLS3312Syllabus.pdf) | [Teaching Evaluation](/Fall2022POLS3312Evaluation.pdf)]

In Fall 2021, I taught _POLS 3316 Statistics for Political Scientists_, an intro-level methods class for undergraduates. This course introduces students to basic statistical theories and concepts as well as the R language. [[Syllabus](/POLS3316Syllabus.pdf) | [Teaching Evaluation](/Fall2021POLS3316Evaluation.pdf)]
