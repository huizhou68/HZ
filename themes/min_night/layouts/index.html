            My dissertation seeks to further our understanding of authoritarian resilience through the lens of crisis management and information control. On the one hand, My analysis of over 2,000 disasters shows that the government responds to disasters by basing punishments on casualties. However, this type of accountability is weakened by the decentralization of crisis management. On the other hand, I study the scope and determinants of Chinese governmentâ€™s censorship towards Internet users located outside its border. It turns out that around 18.92% of 16,479 Chinese government websites are engaging in censorship to deny access to outsiders. Further analysis demonstrates that economic development does not make a government more open to the outside, but export and foreign direct investment are significantly associated with less censorship. My study suggests that a more open society can arise from international exchanges rather than domestic socioeconomic development, at least in the field of E-government.
