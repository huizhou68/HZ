            My dissertation examines how Chinese government deals with accountability in the absence of competitive elections and other democratic means. My study seeks to further our understanding of authoritarian resilience through the lens of crisis management and information control. On the one hand, I examine how Chinese bureaucrats are held accountable by compiling an original dataset that includes over 2,000 major disasters taking place in China since 2000. My analysis shows that the government responds to  disasters by disciplining bureaucrats based on casualties. However, this type of accountability is weakened by the decentralization of crisis management. On the other hand, I also study  the scope and determinants of Chinese governmentâ€™s censorship towards Internet users located outside its border. It turns out that around 18.92% of Chinese government websites are engaging in censorship to deny access to outsiders. Further analysis demonstrates that economic development does not make a government more open to the outside, but export and foreign direct investment are significantly associated with less censorship. My study suggests that a more open society can arise from international exchanges rather than domestic socioeconomic development, at least in the field of E-government.
