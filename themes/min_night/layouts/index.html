My research fields include public policy and comparative politics. I am interested in how political institutions and economic factors shape bureaucratic accountability, government responsiveness, and policy outcomes in authoritarian contexts, with a particular focus on China. Besides, I am also interested in big data techniques such as text analysis and machine learning. My research has been published in <i>Journal of Contemporary China</i>, <i>Social Science & Medicine</i> and <i>International Journal of Legal Medicine</i>. In addition, I coauthored a book chapter on China’s social policy and social equity.

            My dissertation seeks to further our understanding of authoritarian resilience in China through the lens of crisis management and information control. On the one hand, My analysis of over 2,000 disasters shows that the government responds to disasters by basing punishments on casualties. However, this type of accountability is weakened by the decentralization of crisis management. On the other hand, I study the scope and determinants of Chinese government’s censorship towards Internet users located outside its border. It turns out that around 18.92% of 16,479 Chinese government websites are engaging in censorship to deny access to outsiders. Further analysis demonstrates that economic development does not increase government openness to the outside, but export and foreign direct investment are significantly associated with less censorship. My study suggests that a more open society can arise from international exchanges rather than domestic socioeconomic development, at least in the field of E-governance.
