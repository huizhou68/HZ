I expect to graduate in 2022. My research fields include public policy and comparative politics. I am interested in how political institutions and economic factors shape bureaucratic accountability, government responsiveness, and policy outcomes in authoritarian contexts, with a particular focus on China. Besides, I am also interested in big data techniques such as text analysis and machine learning. My research has been published in <i>Journal of Contemporary China</i>, <i>Social Science & Medicine</i> and <i>International Journal of Legal Medicine</i>. In addition, I coauthored a book chapter on Chinaâ€™s social policy and social equity.

            My dissertation seeks to further our understanding of bureaucratic accountability in China through the lens of crisis management and information control. On the one hand, my analysis of over 2,000 disasters shows that the government responds to disasters by basing punishment on casualties. Capitalizing on a regression discontinuity design arising from China's decentralization of crisis management, I find that bureaucratic accountability for disasters is weakened due to local protectionism. Utilizing a survey experiment that embeds a recent air crash accident, I find that accountability punishment can have a causal effect on mass support. Politically sophisticated individuals will likely become more supportive of the government after being exposed to information about accountability sanctions, whereas people lacking political knowledge tend to show less support. On the other hand, I also discuss bureaucratic accountability in terms of transparency at the global level through the lens of website censorship towards Internet users located outside its border. It turns out that approximately 14.48% of 16,479 Chinese government websites are engaging in censorship to deny access to outsiders. Further analysis demonstrates that economic development does not increase government openness to the outside, but export and foreign direct investment are significantly associated with less censorship. My study suggests that a more open society can arise from international exchanges rather than domestic socioeconomic development, at least in the field of E-governance.
