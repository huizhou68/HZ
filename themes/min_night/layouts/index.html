My name is Hui Zhou. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at Saint Louis University. I earned my Ph.D degree in Political Science from the University of Houston in 2022. I am interested in how political institutions and economic factors shape bureaucratic accountability, government responsiveness and policy outcomes in authoritarian contexts, with a particular focus on China. Besides, I am also interested in big data techniques such as text analysis and machine learning. My research has been published in the <i>China Review</i>, <i>Journal of Contemporary China</i>, <i>Social Science & Medicine</i> and <i>International Journal of Legal Medicine</i>. Additionally, I coauthored a book chapter on China's social policy and social equity.

            As a quantitative scholar, I am passionate about examining empirical questions by utilizing mainstream causal inference techniques such as experiments, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity designs, instrumental variable estimation and panel data analysis. My dissertation examines China's bureaucratic accountability through the lens of emergency management and information control. Capitalizing on a regression discontinuity design arising from China's decentralization of emergency management, I find that bureaucratic accountability for disasters is weakened due to local protectionism. Utilizing a survey experiment that embeds a recent air crash accident, I find that accountability punishment can undermine mass support when the public lacks political knowledge, but it may boost support among politically sophisticated individuals. Additionally, I scrutinize bureaucratic accountability from the perspective of information access in cyberspace. Based on instrumental variable estimation, my study demonstrates that international trade can advance government accountability by making the government more open to the international community.
