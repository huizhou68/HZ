Hello! My name is Hui Zhou. As of May 2019, I am entering my third year as a Ph.D student of Political Science at the University of Houston. Being a policy major and comparative minor, I am interested in the comparative studies of social policy and political causes and consequences of economic inequality in the U.S. context.
